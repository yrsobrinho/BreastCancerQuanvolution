# Breast Cancer Quanvolution

This repository presents a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning framework for breast cancer detection using medical imaging datasets. By combining classical and quantum techniques, the project explores new frontiers in medical image classification, offering a comparative evaluation of their effectiveness.

## Overview

This project investigates the use of quantum computing—through variational quantum circuits and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs)—in the context of breast cancer detection. It provides implementations for both classical and quantum pipelines and evaluates their performance on standard datasets.
